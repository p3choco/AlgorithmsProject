# AVL and BST Trees Visualization





## Overview

This project is a culmination of my efforts for the "Algorithms" course at my university. I've crafted a graphical representation of both AVL and BST trees, utilizing the power of Spring Framework along with the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) to create a seamless and visually appealing experience for users.

## Features

- **Dynamic Visualization**: As you interact with the trees, the changes are instantaneously reflected in the graphical display, providing a real-time visualization of AVL and BST tree structures.
  
- **Element Addition**: New elements can be easily added to both AVL and BST trees, and their placement can be immediately observed.
  
- **Element Search**: Quickly search for any element within the trees. The search process is not only efficient but also visually represented to better understand the traversal.
  
- **Element Deletion**: Removing elements from the trees is straightforward. After deletion, the tree structure automatically adjusts and visually represents the new configuration.
